I'm a coder based in San Francisco. I've been programming for about 6 years professionally, and I'm interested in blogging about the "softer" side in software-engineering -- namely, exploring the human relationships in how we build software.  Hopefully some of this stuff is interesting to you as well. 

I also dabble in Security. I'm a team member on the entr0py hacking collective along with a few of my friends and former coworkers. We participate in Capture the Flag Tournaments, and you can be able to see some of our write-ups from previous competitions at the [entr0py site](https://entr0py-team.github.io/about/)

Over the past two years, I have been focusing my professional efforts around around Data Science and Data Engineering. I'm pursuing a masters degree at the Georgia Tech with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning.
