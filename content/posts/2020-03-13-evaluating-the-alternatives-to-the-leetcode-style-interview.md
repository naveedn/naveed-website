  There is no one-size-fits-all approach to interviewing. What works for some
  will not work for others. Let's look at some alternative approaches to
  interviewing, and figure out where and why they fall short.

## Current alternatives to LC interviews: Take-Homes

On one hand, we have LeetCode. On the other, we have Take-Home Assessments. Previously, I used to think of these assessments as a superior solution, but after this last round of interviews, I've found it to have mixed results.

#### What they get right

* They allow the interviewee the flexibility to do the interview over a longer period of time, so the "time crunch" isn't a factor. Given the amount of time, a candidate can usually build and present a higher quality solution, which is analogous to the work they would do on the job.
* They are usually more pragmatic in nature, testing a coder's ability to demonstrate knowledge in areas that are analogous to their everyday work (like design patterns, documentation, testing, architecture decisions) -- stuff that would be hard to communicate effectively in the span of an hour long interview.

#### What they get wrong

* They are higher effort for both parties. Because of the asynchronous nature of these projects, getting clarifications on ambiguous wording via email can take anywhere from a couple hours to a few days, throwing you off your groove if you're coding the assessment. Candidates are usually interviewing with a handful of companies at a time, and these take-homes take a disproportionate amount of time when compared a quick LeetCode style interview.

  For the engineers reviewing these projects, you generally have to review a candidates project alongside your other work, whereas with an interview, you have a concrete window in which to handle the interviewing task. And, if you work at a company where you might have a few hundred candidates, this process of individual code review does not scale -- you can't possibly review them all. 
* Because they take place over a longer period of time, they can often balloon in scope. Some companies give lengthy projects as a way to judge efficacy, and there isn't a good standard on what a candidate should and shouldn't accept. The ambiguity makes it difficult for a candidate to know how much to invest, especially if they are interviewing with a few companies at once. Whats the time frame? 3 hours? 6? Should I have a full test suite as well? Not having a clear time frame can muddle the results, making it difficult for interviewers to get a good litmus test, while making some candidates choose an "incorrect" amount of time on the project.

In my own experience, I found myself actually wanting to do a LeetCode interview after getting rejected by a company after doing their take home. For me, doing that one programming project took the span of scheduling and completing about 3 LC style phone screens. It's just not a good use of my time. 

However, for some people, this is still a great way to interview, and for the companies offering it, I applaud you for not cargo culting. If this is your jam, I would highly recommend taking a look at [the list of companies that don't do whiteboard interviews.](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards)
