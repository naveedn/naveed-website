Over the past 6 months, I've gotten the opportunity to work remotely (at home) as part of an experiment to see if I was cut out for the "remote year travel-and-work" lifestyle that seems to be popular on Medium. With the rising public hysteria about Coronavirus and its potential to derail businesses, many workers are being advised to work at home to prevent the spread of the illness. But for workers like me -- extroverted communicators who are influenced by our environments -- there are some real challenges that one needs to adapt to when transitioning into this style of work. 

Any discussion of remote work needs to acknowledge the research *against* it and its effects on an individuals work life balance. Being always available means that for most companies, you're expected to work in your off-hours. This in turn, worsens people's anxieties when, for example, they have to "catch up" with their emails at night. With an inability to extricate work from their lives, people feel more dissatisfied and eventually burn out.  

The counterclaim by many articles is that people who take breaks frequently tend to perform better. You're pitched that "turning off" when you get home, taking your earned vacations / sick leave, and enforcing boundaries are the keys to having a successful work-life balance.

So which is it? How can we maintain both productivity and a good work life balance? Which aspects from both camps do we need to adopt to thrive as remote workers? While everyone and their grandma have written an article on how to be productive doing remote work, I'll approach this by highlighting certain gotcha's or nuances that took me some time to figure out. 

### 0. Create a constraint based environment

This is the first thing one needs to tackle. You need to foster an environment that forces you to be productive. Do your work in the same spot, everyday. Some people have the luxury of having home offices, and others join co-working spaces. In the beginning, I would work in every random spot I could in my apartment. I would alternate between sitting on the couch, doing work on my bed, and sitting at the dining table. I eventually found that if I sit down at my dining table with my laptop first thing in the morning, I could jump into my routine faster. My dining table chairs are uncomfortable, and that helped me stay focused because I'd want to finish my work as soon as possible. Plus, I was so used to watching TV on the couch after work that it was hard not to "check out" when I would sit down to do work there. 

 Some days, I would also try and change my environment entirely; I would scoot over to a library or a coffee shop. And almost every time I would feel less productive than I wanted to be. People usually leave the office to work at a coffee shop so they are interrupted less and can get a chunk of IC (individual contributor) time, but for me, the change in scenery caused my brain to wander more than it let me focus -- not to mention the time spent in transportation, finding a spot, getting set up, etc etc. Working remotely means that you'll have more quiet, isolated chunks than you will meetings and ad-hoc distractions. I found that you don't *really* need to change up your environments, you just need a consistent one that you can jump into quickly.

### 1. Stagger your meetings to work in discrete chunks

Which brings me to the second half of my point: **stagger** your meetings. With these long, isolated chunks of time, it becomes natural to work at a pace that is comfortable for you. You might be trying to figure out how to solve a tough problem, and you might take a 5 minute break to check email or browse reddit. Freed from the social pressures of a group environment, it becomes dangerously easy to let that 5 minutes turn into 15 or 45. The freedom given to you by not having a manager within eyeshot is amazing, but it also gives you enough rope to hang yourself with. In order to make sure you stay on track, its valuable to stagger meetings so that you have a constrained time-box to do IC work in. It forces you to break up your work in chunks to work around those meetings, and it provides natural markers for you to start and stop that kind of work, which let you plan for appropriately sized breaks. 

This is the opposite of what I would do in an office: in order to optimize productivity, i would stack meetings so that I could handle all the interpersonal communications in one chunk, and focus on my engineering work in the other. But modern problems require modern solutions ;)

### 2. Do not confuse your home tasks with work tasks

This one sort of snuck up on me. I'm going to assume that like most engineers, you maintain some sort of todo list to help manage the myriad of tasks you have to do on a daily basis. You might have a list for work tasks, another for home chores, etc. I personally use Todoist for these kinds of things, and I love it. 

The thing is, with most of these todo list task trackers, you often can't differentiate between what areas you are being productive in versus what are areas you *need* to be productive in. To put it another way, having the freedom to do something in front of you leads you down the road of doing things that might be personally productive but not great for your company. There have been times where I might have woken up, done laundry, cleaned the dishes, gotten groceries, but haven't made a dent in my programming tasks for the day. In those instances, its hard not to feel like productive anyways because you knocked off a bunch of items on your checklist. But its a trap! 

My recommendation is to blend work and home tasks in a 2-1 approach. Tackle two work tasks before doing your home tasks. Then repeat. Working from home gives you a fantastic opportunity to take care of your home life in ways that are beneficial to your overall happiness, but one needs to take care in prioritizing their work obligations effectively.

### 3. Manage your stimulant intake

When I worked in an office, I would usually be one of the folks who would brew a full pot of coffee when I noticed it was low. When I started working from home, it was instinctual for me to continue doing that. Without being aware of it, my coffee intake gradually increased from 2-3 cups of coffee a day (which is a lot already, I know) to about 6-8. Meanwhile my productivity began to plateau (and then decrease) despite the numerous caffeine "boosts" I was getting. 

A well timed stimulant like caffeine can get you energized and ready to write code, but do it too often without detox breaks and you'll find yourself like me, drinking a pot of coffee and *still* doing half as much work as I used to do in the office.

Since then, I've replaced every other cup of coffee with tea and water. In the first week afterwards, I felt miserable and terribly unfocused. My work performance took a serious hit. But, despite my anxiety about the situation, my productivity came back after the second week, and I've been able to reduce my coffee intake to normal programmer levels again. It sucks in the immediate term, but its a strategic move to optimize long term productivity.
