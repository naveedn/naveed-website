#### They disenfranchise the middle 60% of all applicants.

 In my most recent interviewing process, I got a chance to interview with one of the bigger software job applicant websites and was able to peel the lid back on how interviews look like from the other side. As part of my interview, I was given a sample of actual data collected by the organization regarding job interviews and job hiring. Given a dataset of 800 real candidates who all scored satisfactory or higher in a LC style assessment, how many of them got a call back from a company? Based on their test score, how many calls did the best candidates get vs anyone who "passed"?

**NOTE: my goal is not to "out" any company, but highlight discrepancies in the hiring process. As a result, I will not be providing specifics about the company or providing information that would compromise their identity.**

In this graph, X axis represents the actual number of calls from a company that a candidate would get, and the Y axis represents the number of applicants receiving the same amount of callbacks.  As you can see, a large percentage of candidate got between 1 and 10 calls back, despite all candidates passing the test. One candidate at the far end got 120 different companies to express interest in them! My first assumption is that this would be look more like bell curve, you know -- where most candidates would get an equal distribution of calls, and the outliers (people doing exceptionally well) would get proportionally more calls, but within reason. 

I suppose, after some reflection, that this actually makes sense -- the best candidates are in short supply, so why wouldn't companies fight tooth-and-nail for them? So, I guess this graph isn't all bad, assuming that the people getting calls are really incredible and knocked the test out of the park relative to their peers.

But that's not actually the case. Do you see that top line in the scatter plot? Those are people that scored perfect (5/5) on the assessment, but most of them got the same number of callbacks as their peers who only scored 3/5. If this assessment was representative of a meritocracy, shouldn't all the people with the perfect test scores be in the top right quadrant of the graph? Why are so many candidates on the left hand side of the graph, despite having great scores and being recommended to the company?

This definitely threw me for a loop in the interview. The interviewers, noticing my perplexed expression, admitted to me that while the platform was exceptional for 20% of candidates, the middle 60% struggled to convert into full-time hires and would churn. In fact, this was an active area of development for the company, playing around with candidate profile visibility so everyone would get a fair shot. All of this is to say that even if you studied hard and did well with this kind of assessment -- there is still no guarantee that you'd actually get the job.
