Roughly 5 years ago, I was getting ready to pack my bags, move to a new city, and start the first job of my post-collegiate career. If I could sit down next to that naively optimistic, entertaining-visions-of-grandeur, excited 23 year old self, here's what I would tell him about Software Engineering:



## Build the simplest thing that works.



## Don't let perfect be the enemy of done.



## Don't struggle in silence, working with others makes you better.
