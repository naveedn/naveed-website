COVID19 has impacted many of us profoundly. Our social patterns have shifted almost overnight. Virtual Hangouts are becoming the norm now for both social and work engagements, instead of the pre-COVID norm of meeting people in person. 

For extroverted programmers like me, it used to be a real challenge in adapting to a long-term remote-work lifestyle. Until my team started doing XP. A lot of the practices highlighted in the 12 principles of XP are effective productivity hacks that make a lot more sense in our remote-first world. Let's unwrap this.

## First off, wtf is XP (eXtreme Programming) and where did it come from?

EXtreme Programming is a software development style that takes the ideas from the Agile Development process and drives them to their "logical extremes", which culminates in a set of practices and philosophies that we should adopt to be better software engineers. I'll sum up the 12 practices here, but I find that [this blog post from 2004](https://web.archive.org/web/20120101190943/http://www.satyakomatineni.com/akc/display?url=DisplayNoteIMPURL&reportId=862&ownerUserId=satya) captures it pretty elegantly. For a verbose definition, check out the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming#Concept).

### 12 Practices:

##### Fine-scale feedback

* Pair programming
* Planning game (I didn't dig into this too much)
* Test-driven development
* Whole team

##### Continuous process

* Continuous integration
* Refactoring or design improvement
* Small releases

##### Shared understanding

* Coding standards
* Collective code ownership
* Simple design
* System metaphor

##### Programmer welfare

* Sustainable pace



### A quick history lesson

We're gonna keep this brief, but here is a 30 second crash course on the history of XP:

\- In the land before time, software teams used a waterfall approach to software development. Most software projects were failures.

\- In the late 90's / early 2000's, a new generation of software engineers met at a famous ski resort and came up with a new paradigm for how we should do software development. That birthed the "agile development" workflow that's ubiquitous in software engineering these days.

\- The original agile movement became fragmented the more popular it grew. Slowly, and then almost all at once, the Agile movement was usurped by some business folks and process oriented project managers. Rigid formalizations of the practices and process bloat infiltrated development teams, big and small. Some people began forking off and experimenting with alternative styles of software development, which is where XP and Kanban come from.

\- While Kanban enjoyed some commercial success (it became largely popular in devops / support heavy teams), XP was decidedly less popular. It was in a bit of a limbo -- some of the original voices of Agile were using XP, like Robert Martin and Kent Beck. But it was considered too unapproachable, too intense, and not justifiable from a business perspective. Indeed, if you visit the wikipedia page for Xtreme Programming, they have a section dedicated to "[Controversial Aspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming#Controversial_aspects)" -- not a ringing bell of endorsement for most people.

## So why adopt it now? What are the benefits and downsides?
