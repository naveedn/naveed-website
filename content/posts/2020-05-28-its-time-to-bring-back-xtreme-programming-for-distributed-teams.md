  COVID19 has impacted many of us profoundly. Our social patterns have shifted
  almost overnight. Virtual Hangouts are becoming the norm now for both social
  and work engagements, instead of the pre-COVID norm of meeting people in
  person. 


  For extroverted programmers like me, it used to be a real challenge in
  adapting to a long-term remote-work lifestyle. Until my team started doing XP.

Since the start of the pandemic, our social patterns have shifted almost overnight. Video calls have become the norm for both social and work engagements. Adapting to a long-term remote work lifestyle is challenging, to say the least. 

However, the process of experimentation has allowed me to discover practices that have increased my work productivity significantly. After reflecting on these new strategies, I realized many of these ideas have already been introduced to the programming community for decades -- but for a variety of reasons, they've been written off as irrelevant or impractical. But now, the confluence of factors that have led to this massive societal shift have allowed these software development approaches to really shine in ways that are unintuitive at first glance. 

## First off, what is XP (Extreme Programming) and where did it come from?

Extreme Programming is a software development style that takes the ideas from the Agile Development process and drives them to their "logical extremes", which culminates in a set of practices and philosophies that we should adopt to be better software engineers. I'll sum up the 12 practices below, but I find that [this blog post from 2004](https://web.archive.org/web/20120101190943/http://www.satyakomatineni.com/akc/display?url=DisplayNoteIMPURL&reportId=862&ownerUserId=satya) captures it pretty elegantly. 

### But first, a quick history lesson

We're gonna keep this brief, so here is a 30 second crash course on the history of XP:

* In the land before time, software teams used a waterfall approach to software development. Most software projects were failures.
*  In the early 2000's, a new generation of software engineers [met at a famous ski resort](https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html) and came up with a new paradigm for how we should do software development. That birthed the "agile development" workflow that's ubiquitous in software engineering these days.
* The original agile movement became fragmented the more popular it grew. Over time, the Agile movement was co-opted by business folks and process-oriented project managers.

  * Rigid formalizations of the practices and process bloat infiltrated development teams, big and small. 
  * People began forking off and experimenting with alternative styles of software development, which is where XP, [Mob Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming#:~:text=Mob%20programming%20(informally%20mobbing)%20is,code%20at%20the%20same%20time.), and Kanban come from.
  * Some methodologies, like Kanban, enjoyed commercial success in niche development teams. Kanban became the preferred strategy in DevOps or client-facing support teams, for example.
* XP was decidedly less popular. It was in a bit of a limbo -- some of the original voices of Agile were using XP, like Robert Martin and Kent Beck. But it was considered too unapproachable, too intense, and not justifiable from a business perspective. Indeed, if you visit the wikipedia page for Xtreme Programming, they have a section dedicated to "[Controversial Aspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming#Controversial_aspects)" -- not a ringing bell of endorsement for most people. 

So what are these practices, and why are they controversial? 

### The 12 Practices of XP:

##### Fine-scale feedback

* Pair programming
* Test-driven development
* Whole team
* Planning game

##### Continuous process

* Continuous integration
* Refactoring or design improvement
* Small releases

##### Shared understanding

* Coding standards
* Collective code ownership
* Simple design
* System metaphor

##### Programmer welfare

* Sustainable pace

## So why adopt it now? What are the benefits and downsides?
